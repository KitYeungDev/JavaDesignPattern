Decorator Pattern
---
Dynamically attach the responsibility to the object . To extend functionality, decorators offer alternatives that are more resilient than inheritance .
- The decorator and the object to be decorated have the same super type
- You can wrap an object with one or more decorators .
- The decorator may add its own behavior before / or after the act of the decorator is entrusted to achieve a specific purpose.
