Strategy Pattern
---
In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioural software design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. The strategy pattern:
- defines a family of algorithms
- encapsulates each algorithm
- makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family
